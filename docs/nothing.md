## Battery Drain

If you have recently purchased the Nothing Phone Series, it might be running a very old firmware version, which is the reason for weird performance. Increased battery consumption may occur until you update to the latest version.

*We also recommend doing the following:*

1. Clear the cache and storage of the Nothing Launcher.  
2. Clear the cache and delete the data of Google Play Services. *if os is fresh installed* 
3. Clear the cache of Google Play Services for AR.  
4. Set the battery usage mode for Nothing Launcher to "RESTRICTED."  
5. Disable notification access for Nothing Launcher.  
6. Restart and fully charge your phone.  

## Chargers

- Nothing Phone 1 - 33 Watts

## Disabling Call Recording Notification During a Call

To disable the voice notification that call recording has started, follow these steps:

1. Install **`TTSLexx`** from **Google Play**.
2. In your phone settings, search for **`Text-to-Speech`** and open it.
3. In the **Text-to-Speech** settings, select **`Default Text-to-Speech Engine`** and choose **`TTSLexx`**.
4. Go to **Apps** in the settings, find the **Phone app**, and open it. Tap Clear Cache and Clear Storage. Your contacts will remain safe (this is confirmed for the Google Phone app).

!!! note
    The notification about call recording will appear during the first call, but it will not occur in subsequent calls.
