# Streisand

Streisand is expected to be used on iOS devices only. If you are an Android user, please use the following alternatives:  
- [NekoBox](nekoray.md/#install)  
- Amnezia  

## Configuration

### Get the configuration
In our case, we use [3x-ui](3x-ui.md). Log in to the panel and then open the inbounds page. Find the client you need and then click on the QR-code icon.

### Import configuration into Streisand
In Streisand, there is a "plus" icon in the top right corner. Click it and import your configuration in one of the following ways: scan the QR-code or click the QR-code in the panel to copy it to the clipboard, then press "import from clipboard" inside the app.

### Connecting
Move to the main menu and simply click the big blue toggle button in the center (and select the profile you need in the "Local servers" section if you have multiple). iOS will ask for permission to add a profile to the system; you need to grant permission, and then you are good to go.

### Checking connection
Check the connection by clicking the "Connected" or "Not connected" button below the toggle button. Verify that there is an IP-address you expected to see.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Streisand documentation](https://github.com/jlund/streisand/wiki) or seek help from the community.
