# iPhone usage notes

## Periodic Phone Wipe Notes

It is a good manner to wipe your device every N-period. I would recommend wiping iPhone with every major release (iOS 17 -> 18). Why? Because it is iOS.

This page was written because I merged from iPhone 12 (64GB) to Nothing Phone (2).

## Backup
- Manually uploading all files to Nextcloud if iCloud storage is full
- Reset your phone and set it up fresh, not by using a backup. However if it only contains your personal files, then you may. But I'd prefer doing everything manually.
- You can't downgrade if your iOS is NOT jail-broke
